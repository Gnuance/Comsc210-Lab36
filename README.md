# LAB 36: BST
## Requirements
    1. Modify the class to process the codes found in the codes.txt file, which are strings, rather than integers.
    2. Write a program that creates and populates a BST from these records. 
    3. Add interactive, menu-driven functionality to add, delete, search, and modify records.
