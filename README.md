# LAB 36: BST
## Requirements
    1. Modify the class to process the codes found in the codes.txt file, which are strings, rather than integers.
    2. Write a program that creates and populates a BST from these records. 
    3. Add interactive, menu-driven functionality to add, delete, search, and modify records.

## Initial thoughts
    + Converting to strings from ints shouldn't be too hard; standard string comparison is included by default with the language.

## Design Decisions
     

## Completion Updates
    + Converted binary tree declaration & definition files to string from int.
